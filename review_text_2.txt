Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of Godzilla X Kong Screening. Man, that was not Very Good At All. Boring as Hell. Where is the Gravitas by the Characters from Previous Films in this? Now, all of a Sudden, everything is a Damn Joke Now? Also the Plotline, there was way too damn much going on and this Film has Completely Inferior Visuals compared to the Previous Entries.👎 Godzilla X Kong is in my opinion nowhere near the other Legendary Films, Specifically Godzilla Vs Kong or Godzilla King of the Monsters(KOTH is just Very Slightly Behind GVK, I loved KOTM, but GVK was Such an Experience).👎 The Visuals in this Film at almost 100% of the Time, were not Eye Popping or Amazing at All, Absolutely Terrible Compared to, Godzilla 2014, Kong Skull Island, and Nowhere Near KOTH and GVK.(The Suplex looked Great though 😂)👎 Also, I remember feeling the Power of Godzillas Charge Up Atomic Blast in Godzilla King of the Monsters. Where was that Energy in this? It wasn't the Same Amazing Charge Up, and Godzilla Supposedly had even More Power with the Pink Atomic Blast. Where was the Power Flying Across the Auditorium? It was Underwhelming as Hell.👎 Then on to the Plotlines, there was way too damn much going on, one of the Plotlines was Like Kong Skull Island ........but on Steroids.👂🎵 Another thing, the Score and Music, I liked it very much but it's used so badly in the Film, it's just sort of like Background Noise instead of Elevating what's Happening on screen.🤷 Also, Brian Tyree Henry has a couple of Laughs but he was Very Underwhelming here. He was Absolutely Hilarious in Godzilla Vs Kong. Very Disappointing, although Dan Stevens and He have this Particular Joke together that was Funny though 😂.🙋Rebecca Hall was Ok.🤦🏻 And then you had all this other Stuff Going on just To get 2 Crappy other Monsters on Screen. After Seeing the Titan Mecha Godzilla and Ghidorah from the 2 Previous Entries. D'you think we can go back to 2 Underwhelming Monsters like these?👎 Also, the other Plotline with Kong and the mini Kong, it was crap in my opinion, it just wasn't good.🤷 Another thing, where is the Gravitas from Godzilla King of Monsters Concerning these World Ending Monsters? Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla King of The Monsters and Godzilla Minus one all were Terrified of these Monsters. Now the characters look at them like they're little Puppies or Something, Good God.What the Hell were they Thinking?The Only Positives I can Give this Film are -1. The Score and Music(although used very Poorly in my opinion)2. The Suplex off the Top Rope.That's it, there's Nothing Else Good about the Film.Overall, this is a 1 Outta 10 at Very Best. Just be Glad we've Watched Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla Minus One, And Godzilla King of the Monsters in Dolby/and or IMAX. The 3 Greatest Entries in my Opinion.
